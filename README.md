# SON-GKEEPER

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/son-gkeeper/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/son-gkeeper/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/son-gkeeper/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
This is [SONATA](http://www.sonata-nfv.eu)'s Service Platform Gatekeeper's repository.

The Gatekeeper is the component that implements all the **Northbound Interface** (NBI) of the Servive Platform.
 
This NBI provides systems like the [son-cli](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-cli), [son-gui](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gui) and [son-bss](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-bss) access to the **Service Platform**, for features like:

 * **accepting new developers**' to be part of the contributors of new developed services;
 * **accepting new services**, in the **package format**, to be deployed in the platform;
 * **validating submited packages**, both in terms of file format and developer submitting the package;
 * **accepting new service instance requests** from customers interested in instantiating a service;
 * **following a service performance** through automatically monitoring each on-boarded service or function;
 * etc..

## Development
This section details what is needed for developing the Gatekeeper.

This repository is organized by **micro-service** (one folder to one micro-service).

Micro-services currently implemented are the following:

1. [`son-gtkapi`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkapi): the only 'door' to the Gatekeeper, where the API is exposed and requests are validated and dispached to the other micro-services of the Gatekeeper;
1. [`son-gtkpkg`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkpkg): where packages are opened, validated and submited to the [Catalogues](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-catalogue-repos);
1. [`son-gtksrv`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtksrv): where requests for services' meta-data are forwarded to the [Catalogues](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-catalogue-repos) and service instantiation requests are sent to the [`MANO Framework`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-mano-framework);
1. [`son-gtkfnct`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkfnct): where requests for functions' meta-data are forwarded to the [Catalogues](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-catalogue-repos) and requests for function metrics are sent to the [Monitoring Framework](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-monitor);
1. [`son-gtkvim`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkvim): through which the [GUI](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gui) accesses VIMs and WIMs configurations;
1. [`son-gtkrec`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkrec): where requests for services' or functions' records are forwarded to the [Repositories](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-catalogue-repos);
1. [`son-gtklic`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtklic): where Licences' are managed;
1. [`son-gtkusr`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkusr): where all User Management's features are implemented;
1. [`son-gtkkpi`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkkpi): where all KPIs' features are implemented;
1. [`son-sec-gw`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-sec-gw): the front-end implementing external secured (`HTTPS`) access;
1. [`son-keycloak`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-keycloak): the back-end of the [User Management](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkusr) micro-service;
1. [`son-gtkrlt`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkrlt): the implemented simple **rate limiter**;

Most of these micro-services have been implemented using [`ruby`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/ruby_2_2) programming language and the [`sinatra`](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) framework. The two exceptions are the [`son-gtklic`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtklic), which is implemented in [`python`](https://www.python.org/) and [`son-keycloak`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-keycloak), implemented in `java` ([`son-sec-gw`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-sec-gw) is just a `NGINx` fron-end, adequately configured). The only need is that the micro-service to be implemented provides a REST API, whatever the language it is implemented in.

### Building
'Building' the Gatekeeper, given the approach mentioned above, is more like 'composing' it from the available micro-services. So:

* each micro-service is provided in its own container (we're using [`docker`](https://github.com/docker/docker));
* the `Dockerfile` in each folder specifies the environment the container needs to work;
* the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of this repository provides the linking of all the micro-services.

### Contributing
Contributing to the Gatekeeper is really easy. You must:

1. Clone [this repository](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper);
1. Work on your proposed changes, preferably through submiting [issues](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/issues);
1. Submit a Pull Request;
1. Follow/answer related [issues](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/issues) (see Feedback-Chanel, below).

## Installation
Installing the Gatekeeper is really easy. You'll need:

1. the [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language: we prefer doing this by using a version manager tool such as [rvm](https://rvm.io) or [rbenv](http://rbenv.org) (we are using version **2.2.3**);
1. in each one of the subfolders, just run:
  1. `bundle install`
  1. please follow each specific folder's instructions on which environment variables to set
  1. `foreman start`

## Tests
We do three kinds of automated tests:

* Unit tests, which are done with the `RSpec` framework (see the `./spec/`folder);
* Integration tests, which are done with a set of `shell` scripts and the `curl` command (see the [`son-tests`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-tests));
* White-box tests, which are done by using the [`ci_reporter`](https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter) `gem`, generating `XML` reports by executing the command

```sh
$ bundle exec rake ci:all
```
everytime a *pull request* is done.

Please see the [several levels of tests](test_levels.md) that may be considered.

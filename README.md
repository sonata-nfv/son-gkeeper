# SON-GKEEPER
This is [SONATA](http://www.sonata-nfv.eu)'s Service Platform Gatekeeper's repository.

The Gatekeeper is the component that implements all the **Northbound Interface** (NBI) of the Servive Platform.
 
This NBI provides systems like the [son-push](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-push), [son-gui](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gui) and [son-bss](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-bss) access to the **Service Platform**, for features like:

 * **accepting new developers**' to be part of the contributors of new developed services;
 * **accepting new services**, in the **package format**, to be deployed in the platform;
 * **validating submited packages**, both in terms of file format and developer submitting the package;
 * **accepting new service instance requests** from customers interested in instantiating a service;
 * **following a service performance** through automatically monitoring each on-boarded service or function;
 * etc..

## Development
This section details what is needed for developing the Gatekeeper.

This repository is organized by **micro-service** (one folder to one micro-service).

Micro-services currently implemented are the following:

1. [`son-gtkapi`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkapi): the only 'door' to the Gatekeeper, where the API is exposed;
1. [`son-gtkpkg`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkpkg): where all Packages features are implemented;
1. [`son-gtksrv`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtksrv): where all Services features are implemented;
1. [`son-gtkfnct`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkfnct): where all Functions features are implemented;
1. [`son-gtkvim`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkvim): where all Vims features are implemented;
1. [`son-gtkrec`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkrec): where all Records§ features are implemented;

All these micro-services have been implemented using [`ruby`](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/ruby_2_2) programming language and the [`sinatra`](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) framework. This is not mandatory, as long as the micro-service to be implemented provides a REST API.

The remaining micro-services ([`son-gtkusr`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkusr), [`son-gtklic`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtklic) and [`son-gtkkpi`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkkpi), and eventually others), will be implemented in the course of the project.

### Building
'Building' the Gatekkeper, given the approach mentioned above, is more like 'composing' it from the available micro-services. So:

* each micro-service is provided in its own container (we're using [`docker`](https://github.com/docker/docker));
* the `Dockerfile` in each folder specifies the environment the container needs to work;
* the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of this repository provides the linking of all the micro-services.

### Contributing
Contributing to the Gatekeeper is really easy. You must:

1. Clone [this repository](http://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper);
1. Work on your proposed changes, preferably through submiting [issues](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/issues);
1. Submit a Pull Request;
1. Follow/answer related [issues](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/issues) (see Feedback-Chanel, below).

## Installation
Installing the Gatekeeper is really easy. You'll need:

1. the [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language: we prefer doing this by using a version manager tool such as [rvm](https://rvm.io) or [rbenv](http://rbenv.org) (we are using version **2.2.3**);
1. in each one of the subfolders, just run:
  1. `bundle install`
  1. please follow each specific folder's instructions on which environment variables to set
  1. `foreman start`

## Tests
We do three kinds of automated tests:

* Unit tests, which are done with the `RSpec` framework (see the `./spec/`folder);
* Integration tests, which are done with a set of `shell` scripts and the `curl` command (see the [`son-tests`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-tests));
* White-box tests, which are done by using the [`ci_reporter`](https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter) `gem`, generating `XML` reports by executing the command

```sh
$ bundle exec rake ci:all
```
everytime a *pull request* is done.

## Usage
Please refer to the [`son-gtkapi`](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/son-gkeeper/tree/master/son-gtkapi) repository and each one of the other folders in this repository for examples of usage of each one of the already developed micro-services.
